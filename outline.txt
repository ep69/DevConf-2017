Motivation
why? there are problems with https certificates
what? understand what's happening 
how? get your hands dirty in command line
beginner level

Theory
* bare minimum
* public key cryptography
  * more security by convenience (private keys don't need to be moved)
  * do not solve the key distribution problem completely
* certificates + PKI
  * address "Is this the right public key?" question
  * certificate binds public key to other information
    * attested by certificate authority
      * which could be further attested by higher-level CA
      * but you must ultimately trust some in the end
* real world steps in


Practice
 * typicaly preinstalled in the system/browser

Building blocks
* get cert from server
* view certificate
* verify certificate

Problems
* types
  * cert vs. reality (~attributes)
    * problems with hostname
      * not matching server
      * CN not present in SAN
      * SNI
    * validity
    * small key, md4
    * key usage
    * depth (kinda trust problem, too)
    * key identifiers not matching
  * cert vs. trust (~chain)
    * self-signed certificate
    * root ca not trusted
    * missing intermediary certificate
    * certificate does not match key
    * server cert is signed by different CA (broaden scenario 2)



Conclusion
* things are MUCH more complicated in practice
* other problems (cipher suites)
